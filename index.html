      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>, a user agent's
        <dfn>environmental conditions</dfn> are primarily expressed as CSS
        <dfn>media features</dfn> (e.g., pixel-density, orientation, max-width,
        etc.) and CSS media types (e.g., print, screen, etc.). A
        <dfn>responsive image</dfn> is an image that adapts in response to
        different <a>environmental conditions</a>: adaptations can include, but
        are not limited to, changing the dimensions, crop, or even the source
        of an image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media
        features</a> are dynamic in nature (e.g., a browser window is re-sized,
        a device is rotated from portrait to landscape, and so on), thus a user
        agent constantly responds to events that change the properties of media
        features. As a document's layout adapts to changes in media features
        and media type, an image's ability to communicate effectively can be
        significantly reduced (e.g., images start to show compression artifacts
        as they are scaled to match the quality of media or some media
        feature). When this happens, developers rely on various <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        client/server-side solutions</a> to present images at different
        resolutions, or even in different formats. Swapping images provides a
        means to continue communicating effectively as the features of media
        change dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, as the <a href=
        "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/wiki/Display-technologies:-beyond-Retina">
        number and varieties of high-density screens has increased</a> (both on
        mobile and desktop devices), web developers have had to create custom
        techniques for serving images that best match a browser's
        <a>environmental conditions</a>. For a list of examples of the range of
        <dfn>techniques</dfn> in use in 2012, see Chris Coyier's article
        "<a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">Which
        responsive images solution should you use?</a>". These techniques have
        a number of limitations, discussed below, which serve as the motivation
        to standardize a solution through the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a>
        and <a href="http://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In formulating the requirements, this document tries to be
        <em>neutral</em> - it is not predicated on any solution. The document
        only tries to describe the use cases and what the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> understands, from
        <a href=
        "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/wiki/Relevant-resources#articles">
        practice</a>, would be needed to address the use cases in the form of
        <a>requirements</a>. The <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> expects that a
        technical specification can be created to formally address each of the
        <a>requirements</a> (i.e., the <dfn>solution</dfn>).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Proposed Solutions
        </h3>
        <p>
          To date, four such specifications are currently under development,
          described below. The four proposed solutions are not mutually
          exclusive: together they address the set of <cite><a href=
          "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org">Use Cases and Requirements for
          Responsive Images</a></cite>.
        </p>

          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Allows authors to define various image resources and “hints” that
              assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate image
              source to display. Given a set of image resources, the user agent
              has the option of either following or overriding the author’s
              declarations to optimize the user experience based on criteria
              such as display density, connection type, user preferences, and
              so on.

              Building on <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">srcset</a>,
              this specification defines a declarative solution for grouping
              multiple versions of an image based on different characteristics
              (e.g., format, resolution, orientation, etc.). This allows the
              user agent to select the optimum image to present to an end-user
              based on the user agent's <a>environmental conditions</a>, while
              also providing the ability to "<a title="art direction">art
              direct</a>" images.

          <dd>
            <p>
              Defines a set of HTTP headers that allow browsers to indicate a
              list of device and agent specific preferences. Servers can then
              use these "client hints" to assist in content negotiation,
              ideally resulting in content being served that best matches the
              <a>environmental conditions</a> of the client for the resource
              being requested.

          <dd>
            <p>
              The <cite>RespImg Syntax</cite> introduces a new
              "<code>src-n</code>" attribute set on the <code>img</code>
              element that accepts a small set of microsyntaxes. These
              microsyntaxes address the viewport-based selection,
              device-pixel-ratio-based selection, and art direction use cases
              described in this document. The proposal claims to avoid the
              implementor concerns associated with the `picture` element
              proposal.

      <h2>
        Limitations of current techniques
      </h2>
      <p>
        As currently there are no standardized solutions implemented in
        mainstream browsers, web developers are relying on various <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        techniques</a> to use responsive images in their applications.
        Unfortunately, there are significant <dfn>limitations</dfn> with these
        <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        techniques</a>:

          Reliance on semantically neutral elements and CSS backgrounds:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Large images incur unnecessary download and processing time,
            slowing the experience for users. To work around this problem, web
            developers specify multiple sources of the same image at different
            resolutions and then pick the image of the correct size based on
            the viewport size. As web developers lack the markup to achieve
            what they need, they end up relying on semantically neutral
            elements, <a href=
            "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds/#background-image">CSS
            background images</a>, and JavaScript libraries. In other words,
            developers are being forced to willfully violate the authoring
            requirements of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>.

          Bypass preload scanner
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The reliance on semantically neutral elements (e.g., the
            <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> elements), instead of
            semantically meaningful elements such as <code>img</code>, prevents
            browsers from loading the image resources until after the DOM has
            (at least partially) loaded and scripts have run. This directly
            hinders the performance work browser engineers have done over the
            years to optimize resource loading (e.g., WebKit's <a href=
            "https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp">
            HTMLPreloadScanner</a>). Unnecessarily bypassing things like the
            preload scanner can have measurable performance impact when loading
            documents. See, for example, "<a href=
            "http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/01/webkit-preloadscanner.html">The
            WebKit PreloadScanner</a>" by Tony Gentilcore for a small study
            that demonstrates an up to 20% impact in load time when WebKit's
            PreloadScanner is disabled. More recent <a href=
            "https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/8AwRUE7wqAE">performance
            tests</a> yield similar results.

        <p>
          Developers generally want to provide the same image in multiple
          resolutions, so that high-res devices can get the optimum image for a
          given resolution, while low-resolution devices can avoid wasting time
          and bandwidth downloading overly-large files.

        <h3>
          Viewport-based selection
        </h3>
        <p>
          Image dimensions in responsive layouts tend to vary according to the
          size of the viewport. This often results in images with large
          dimensions (e.g., 2x or more times the size of the viewport) being
          sent to browsers with narrow viewports, which are then resized by the
          browser to fit the design (see, for example, <cite><a href=
          "http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/">Retina
          Revolution</a></cite> by Daan Jobsis and the <cite><a href=
          "http://filamentgroup.com/lab/rwd_img_compression/">compressive
          images</a></cite> technique). Ideally, developers would like to serve
          images that match the user's viewport dimensions. Without a means to
          do this, they sometimes need to send more data to the user than they
          would otherwise need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a 1000px wide image might be appropriate as a 1x image
          when used to fill the background of the page, but it’s far too large
          to use for the same purpose on a 320px wide screen. On a screen that
          small, it’s more like a 2x or 3x image. In other words, the same
          image might be applicable to multiple viewport sizes, but at
          different effective resolutions.
        </p>

          <figcaption>
            <p>
              To avoid sending excess data, developers will send images that
              more closely match the size of the viewport.

          Device-pixel-ratio-based selection
        </h3>
        <p>
          To display images in a way that reduces perceptible artifacts (i.e.,
          so the images look "crisp"), devices with different screen densities
          require images with different minimal resolutions. Thus, the higher
          the pixel density, the more pixels an image needs to have to look
          good. This also applies to icons, where completely different images
          may need to be used for different device-pixel-ratios (see
          <cite><a href=
          "http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/708404794/ios-app-icon-sizes">All the
          sizes of iOS app icons</a></cite>, by Neven Mrgan).

              On a device with a device-pixel-ratio greater than 1, higher

              resulting from compression.

        <h3>
          <dfn>Art direction</dfn>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a responsive design, it is typical to change an image so it can be
          targeted towards the features of a particular display (or set of
          displays). Sometimes this means cropping an image. Other times, it
          can mean a different image altogether that may have different
          proportions or may be changed in other ways to communicate more
          effectively in a layout. This means, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On a large screen, a large image with plenty of details can be
          shown (e.g., an object with a broad background).
          </li>
          <li>On a smaller screen, shrinking the same image can reduce its
          relevance, usefulness, and legibility. Thus, by "art directing", a
          web developer can better control communication by explicitly
          dictating which image should be shown at which size (or when some
          <a title="environmental conditions">environmental condition</a> is
          met).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is illustrated in the figure below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/art_direction.jpg" style="max-width:400px" class=
          "stretchy" alt="four devices showing art directed crops of a dog.">
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              Using different images that have been cropped to fit a particular
              screen's features can help in communicating a message
              effectively.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A related use case is when orientation determines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the source of the image,
          </li>
          <li>the crop,
          </li>
          <li>and how text flows around the image based on the size of the
          viewport.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, on the Nokia Lumia site where it describes the <a href=
          "http://browser.nokia.com/smartphones.html">Meego browser</a>, the
          Nokia Lumia is shown horizontally on wide screens. As the screen
          narrows, the Nokia Lumia is then shown vertically and cropped. Bryan
          and Stephanie Rieger, the designers of the site, explained that on a
          wide screen, showing the full phone horizontally showed the browser
          best; but on small screens, changing the image to vertical made more
          sense because it allowed the reader to still make out the features of
          the browser in the image.

        <h3>
          Design breakpoints
        </h3>
        <p>
          In Web development, a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> is one of a series of
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media
          Queries</a>, which can update the styles of a page based on matching
          of <a>media features</a>. A single breakpoint represents a rule (or
          set of rules) that determines the point at which the contents of that
          media query are applied to a page’s layout. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" style="overflow:auto">
@media screen and (max-width: 16em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 32em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 41em) { ... }
</pre>
        <p>
          Developers currently match specific <a title=
          "breakpoint">breakpoints</a> for images to the breakpoints that they
          have defined in the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> for their
          applications. Being able to match the breakpoints ensures that images
          are operating under the same rules that define the layout of a
          design. It also helps developers verify their approach by ensuring
          that the same viewport measurement tests are being used in both
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>. If the
          developer cannot specify breakpoints for images in the same manner
          that they are defined for the design, developers will need to convert
          the breakpoints back to the values specified in the layout in order
          to verify that they match. This increases authoring time and the
          likelihood of human-error on the part of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <a>breakpoint</a> is specified as "<code>max-width:
          41em</code>", then web developers would like to define a similar
          breakpoint for images at a <code>max-width</code> of
          <code>41em</code>. Otherwise they are forced to transform
          measurements into another unit, like pixels, which is tedious and
          potentially error-prone.

        <p>
          According to <cite>Wikipedia's</cite> article on "<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dots per inch</a>":
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "An&nbsp;inkjet printer&nbsp;… is typically capable of 300-600 DPI.

          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As printers generally have the ability to pack more points per inch
          than a device's screen, printers have to compensate for the lack of
          pixel data by applying&nbsp;<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
          "Reprographic">reprographic</a>&nbsp;techniques, such as <a href=

          simulate&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_tone"
          title="Continuous tone">continuous tone</a>&nbsp;in imagery. As
          illustrated below, applying such techniques can cause images to look

              Example of a 48px by 48px image and text printed at 1,200 DPI.
              Because of the lack of image data, the printer compensates by
              using the <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a> <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=

              stays crisp and is printed at the full 1,200 DPI.

          Allowing developers to reference images at different resolutions
          could allow user agents to choose an image that best matches the
          capabilities of the printer. For example, a photo sharing site could
          provide a bandwidth-optimized image for display on screen, but a
          high-resolution image for print. The same technique could also be
          used for e-book formats, such as <a href=

        <p>
          However, displaying a color image on monochrome media (e.g., paper
          and e-ink displays) can be problematic: different colors with similar
          luminosity are impossible to distinguish on monochrome media. This
          problem is illustrated in the figure below, where it becomes nearly
          impossible to associate slices of a pie chart with corresponding
          labels.

          Currently, server-side solutions exist to adapt web content to e-ink
          displays (e.g., <a href="http://kinstant.com/">kinstant</a>), but
          such services only work on text and layout and not on images. As
          interpreting the meaning of images is a problem of <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>, it is
          infeasible that this problem can ever be computationally solved. The
          only feasible solution is for authors to provide alternative image
          content that communicates effectively in monochrome media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, through the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media Queries
          specifications</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS
          Working Group</a> continues to add media features to the Web
          platform. New media features in <a href=

          The lack of a declarative mechanism to associate image content with

        <h3>
          Relative units
        </h3>
        <p>
          A common practice in creating flexible layouts is to specify the size
          values in media queries as relative units (e.g., <code>em</code>s or
          percentages). This approach allows layouts to match the users’
          default font size (based on zoom level), and it avoid cases where the
          layout breaks on devices who set a default font-size is set to
          something other than the usual 16px.
        </p>
        <p>
          If art-directed images are not specified in relative units, they can
          either break the layout or become distorted when faced with a
          uncommon default font-size (e.g., Amazon's Kindle defaults to 20px
          instead of the usual 16px).

        <h3>
          Image formats
        </h3>
        <p>
          Developers rely on the different capabilities of a range of image
          formats to communicate effectively. These capabilities include, but
          are not limited to, alpha transparency, animation, high-color depth
          support, or better compression ratios for certain image categories.
          For example, JPEG offers developers good optimization between image
          quality and file size, but lacks alpha transparency or animation. So,
          in cases where alpha transparency or animation is needed, developers
          may instead rely on PNG, GIF, and emerging formats like WebP.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a responsive design, images need to be displayed at different
          sizes and device pixel ratios. When possible, a vector format such as
          SVG might be most appropriate. There have also been proposals for new
          responsive image formats (see, for example, <a href=
          "http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/need-responsive-image-format">Christopher
          Schmitt's .net article</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although a web developer may want to use a specific image format, new
          or otherwise, the browser may not always support it. Currently,
          developers are forced to abandon the most suitable image format in

        <h3>
          User control over sources
        </h3>
        <p>
          In situations where the user knows their bandwidth is limited or
          expensive (e.g., while roaming), the browser could assist users by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Giving users an option to only download images in the quality
          they desire - or disable images all together.
          </li>
          <li>Automatically select the most suitable image for the browsing
          environment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are browsers already catering for these kinds of situations.
          For example, Opera Mini provides users with a choice of image quality
          (but those images are compressed on the server). Amazon's Silk
          browser also compresses images "in the cloud" (i.e., through their
          own proxy servers) before serving those images to a user's device.
          Google Chrome also allows users to disable images altogether through
          "site preferences".

      <h2>
        Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <a>use cases</a> give rise to the following
        <dfn>requirements</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To allow for art direction, the <a>solution</a> MUST afford
            developers the ability to match image sources with particular media
            features and/or media types - and the user agent SHOULD update the
            source of an image as the media features and media types of the
            browser environment change dynamically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST support selection based on viewport
            dimensions, screen resolution, and device-pixel-ratio (DPR).
            Sending the right image for the given dimension and DPR avoids
            delaying the page load, wasting bandwidth, and potentially reduces
            the impact on battery life (as the device's antenna can be powered
            off more quickly and smaller images are faster to process and
            display). It can also potentially save users money by not
            downloading redundant image data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST degrade gracefully on legacy user agents
            by, for example, relying on HTML's built-in fallback mechanisms and
            legacy elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers with the ability to
            include content that is accessible to assistive technologies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST NOT require server-side processing to
            work. However, if required, server-side adaptation can still occur
            through <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">content
            negotiation</a> or similar techniques (i.e., they are not mutually
            exclusive).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers the ability to define
            the breakpoints for images as either minimum values (mobile first)
            or maximum values (desktop first) to match the media queries used
            in their design.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> SHOULD allow developers to specify images in
            different formats (or specify the format of a set of image
            sources).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To provide compatibility with legacy user agents, it SHOULD be
            possible for developers to <a href=
            "http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/">polyfill</a>
            the <a>solution</a>. See the <a href=
            "https://github.com/w3ctag/extending-html-responsibly/blob/master/RICG-recs/ricg.md">
            W3C's TAG's recommendations to the RICG.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> SHOULD afford user agents with the ability to
            provide a user-settable preference for controlling which source of
            an image they prefer.&nbsp;For example, &nbsp;preference options
            could include: "always lowest resolution", "always high
            resolution", "download high resolution as bandwidth permits", and
            so on. To be clear, user agents are not required to provide such a
            user-settable preference, but the <a>solution</a> needs to be
            designed in such a way that it could be done.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In order to avoid introducing delays to the page load, the solution
            MUST integrate well with existing performance optimization provided
            by browsers (e.g., the solution would work well with a browser's
            the preload scanner). Specifically, the solution needs to result in
            faster page loads than the current <a href=
            "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
            techniques</a> are providing.
