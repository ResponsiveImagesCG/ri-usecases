      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <span><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a></span>, a user
        agent's <dfn>environmental conditions</dfn> are primarily expressed as
        CSS <dfn>media features</dfn> (e.g., max-width, orientation,
        monochrome, etc.) and CSS media types (e.g., print, screen, etc.). A
        <dfn>responsive image</dfn> is an image that a developer explicitly
        adapts in response to different <span>environmental conditions</span>:
        adaptations can include, but are not limited to, changing the width,
        height, or even the source of an image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media
        features</a> are dynamic in nature (e.g., a browser window is re-sized,
        a device is rotated from portrait to landscape, and so on), thus a user
        agent constantly responds to events that change the properties of media
        features. As a web page's layout adapts to changes in media features
        and media type, an image's ability to communicate effectively can be
        significantly reduced (e.g., images start to show compression artefacts
        as they are scaled to match the quality of media or some media
        feature). When this happens, developers rely on <span>responsive
        images</span> to present images at different resolutions, or even in
        different formats (e.g., swapping to SVG), to make sure their images
        continue communicating effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, as the number and varieties of high-density screens has
        increased (both on mobile and desktop devices), web developers have had
        to create custom techniques for serving images that best match a
        browser's <span>environmental conditions</span>. For a list of examples
        of the range of <dfn>techniques</dfn> in use in 2012, see Chris
        Coyier's article "<a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">Which
        responsive images solution should you use?</a>". These techniques have
        a number of shortcomings, which are discussed below (and these
        shortcomings serve as the motivation to reach out to the <a href=
        "http://w3.org">W3C</a> and <a href="http://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a> for
        standardization).
      </p>
      <p>
        In formulating the requirements, this document tries to be
        <em>neutral</em> - it is not predicated on any solution. The document
        only tries to describe the use cases and what the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> understands, from
        practice, would be needed to address the use cases in the form of
        <span>requirements</span>. The <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> expects that a
        technical specification can be created to formally address each of the
        <span>requirements</span> (i.e., the <dfn>solution</dfn>). To date, two
        such specifications are currently under development:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <cite><a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">The picture
          element: An HTML extension for responsive images</a></cite>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <cite><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">The srcset attribute:
          An HTML extension for adaptive images</a></cite>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the one hand, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">the `srcset`
        attribute</a> allows authors to define various image resources and
        “hints” that assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate
        image source to display. Given a set of image resources, the user agent
        has the option of either following or overriding the author’s
        declarations to optimize the user experience based on criteria such as
        <a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching">display
        density</a>, connection type, <a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#user-control-over-sources">user
        preferences</a>, and so on.
      </p>On the other hand, <a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">the
      `picture` element</a> defines conditions under which the browser should
      follow the author's intentions when selecting which resource to display.
      This includes image source sizes designed to align with layouts
      variations specified in CSS media queries ( see: <a href=
      "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#design-breakpoints">design
      breakpoints</a>, <a href=
      "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#matching-media-features-and-media-types">
      media features and types</a> and <a href=
      "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#relative-units">relative units</a>
      ) or content variations for increased clarity and focus based on the
      <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction">client’s
      display size</a>.
      <p>
        The two proposed solutions are not mutually exclusive: together they
        address the set of <cite><a href=

      <h2>
        Problems with current techniques
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are a number of problems with the <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        techniques</a> currently being relied on by web developers:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Reliance on semantically neutral elements and CSS backgrounds:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Large images incur unnecessary download and processing time,
            slowing the experience for users. To solve this problem, web
            developers provide multiple sources of the same image at different
            resolutions and then pick the image of the correct size based on
            the viewport size. This is commonly done for CSS background images
            in responsive designs, but web developers lack the markup to do so
            for images in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>
            without hacking together a solution. This means that developers
            have resorted to using <code>div</code> and other container
            elements to achieve the desired functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, developers are being forced to work around, or
            completely ignore, authoring requirements of <span><a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a></span>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Reliance on scripts and server side processing:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The <a href=
            "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
            techniques</a> rely on either JavaScript or a server-side solution
            (or both), which adds complexity and redundant HTTP requests to the
            development process. Furthermore, the script-based solutions will
            be unavailable to users who have turned off JavaScript.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The <abbr title="Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr>
        believes standardization of a browser-based solution can overcome these
        problems.

      <h2>
        Use cases
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following <dfn>use cases</dfn> represent situations in which Web
        developers see a need for a browser-based solution for working with
        responsive images.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Resolution switching
        </h3>
        <p>
          Image dimensions in responsive layouts tend to vary according to the
          viewport size, often resulting in large images sent to browsers with
          narrow viewports, only to be downsized there
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a need to enable browsers to request image resources that
          are as close as possible to these images display dimensions. That is
          in order to avoid delaying the page load, wasting bandwidth, draining
          the user's battery and incurring costs on his data plan, by sending
          him image data that he will not benefit from.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use case can be divided into two sub-categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device pixel ratio based resolution switching - Different screen
          densities require different image resolutions in order to display the
          same image dimensions in a crisp, artifact-free way
            <figure>
              <div>
                <img src="images/dpr-camera-man.jpg" width="1200" height="320"
                style="max-width:1200px" class="stretchy" alt=
                "an image displayed at 1x DPR, the same resolution stretched to display at 2x DPR, and with double the resolution at 2x DPR">
              </div>
              <figcaption>
                <p>
                  On a device with a device pixel ratio greater than 1, higher
                  image resolutions are required to eliminate artifacts.
                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>Viewport dimensions based resolution switching - Different
          viewport sizes result in different image dimensions
            <figure>
              <div>
                <img src="images/viewport-camera-man.jpg" width="960" height=
                "320" style="max-width:960px" class="stretchy" alt=
                "the same photograph at two resolutions, but displayed in equal-width viewports, will look identical">
              </div>
              <figcaption>
                <p>
                  To optimize performance, authors can use images that more
                  closely match the viewport size.
                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
        </ul>

          The reason display dimensions are not considered for the resolution

          Art direction
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a responsive design, it is typical to change an image so it can be
          targeted towards the features of a particular display (or set of
          displays). Sometimes this means cropping an image. Other times, it
          can mean a new form of an image that may have different proportions
          or may be changed in other ways to match changes in the layout. This
          means, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On large screens, a large image is shown (e.g., an object or
          person with a broad background).
          </li>
          <li>On smaller screens, shrinking the image can reduce its relevance,
          usefulness, and legibility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is illustrated in the figure below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <div>
            <img src="images/art_direction.jpg" width="800" height="520" style=
            "max-width:800px" class="stretchy" alt=
            "four devices showing art directed crops of a dog">
          </div>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              Using different images that have been cropped to fit a particular
              screen's features can help in communicating a message
              effectively.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A related use case is when orientation determines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the source of the image,
          </li>
          <li>the crop,
          </li>
          <li>and how text flows around the image based on the size of the
          viewport.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, on the Nokia Lumia site where it describes the <a href=
          "http://browser.nokia.com/smartphones.html">Meego browser</a>, the
          Nokia Lumia is shown horizontally on wide screens. As the screen
          narrows, the Nokia Lumia is then shown vertically and cropped. Bryan
          and Stephanie Rieger, the designers of the site, explained that on a
          wide screen, showing the full phone horizontally showed the browser
          best; but on small screens, changing the image to vertical made more
          sense because it allowed the reader to still make out the features of
          the browser in the image.

          Design breakpoints
        </h3>
        <p>
          In Web development, a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> is one of a series of CSS
          Media Queries that updates the styles of a page based on logical
          matching of media features. A single breakpoint represents a rule (or
          set of rules) that determines the point at which the contents of that
          media query are applied to a page’s layout. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
@media screen and (max-width: 16em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 32em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 41em) { ... }
</pre>
        <p>
          Developers currently match specific <span>breakpoints</span> for
          images to the breakpoints that they have defined in the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> of their
          responsive designs. Being able to match the breakpoints ensures that
          images are operating under the same rules that define the layout of a
          design. It also helps developers verify their approach by ensuring
          that the same viewport measurement tests are being used in both
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>. If the
          developer cannot specify breakpoints for images in the same manner
          that they are defined for the design, developers will need to convert
          the breakpoints back to the values specified in the layout in order
          to verify that they match. This increases authoring time and the
          likelihood of errors on the part of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <span>breakpoint</span> is specified as
          "<span class="example"><code>max-width: 41em</code></span>", then web
          developers would like to define a similar breakpoint for images at a
          <code>max-width</code> of <code>41em</code>. Otherwise they are
          forced to transform measurements into another unit like pixels, which
          is tedious and potentially error-prone for developers.

          Matching media features and media types
        </h3>
        <p>
          According to <cite>Wikipedia's</cite> article on "<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dots per inch</a>":
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "An&nbsp;inkjet printer&nbsp;… is typically capable of 300-600 DPI.
            A&nbsp;laser printer&nbsp;… [prints] in the range of 600 to
            1,800&nbsp;DPI."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As printers generally have the ability to pack more points per inch
          than a device's screen, printers have to compensate for the lack of
          pixel data by applying&nbsp;<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
          "Reprographic">reprographic</a>&nbsp;techniques, such as <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">half toning</a>, to
          simulate&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_tone"
          title="Continuous tone">continuous tone</a>&nbsp;in imagery. As
          illustrated below, applying such techniques can cause images to look
          blurry and low-quality when compared to text.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/printed_image.jpg" width="403" height="107" alt=

            <p>
              Example of a 48px by 48px image and text printed at 1,200 DPI.
              Because of the lack of image data, the printer compensates by
              using the <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a> <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
              "Reprographic">reprographic</a> technique. Note that the text
              stays crisp and is printed at the full 1,200 DPI.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Allowing developers to reference images at different resolutions
          could allow user agents to choose an image that best matches the
          capabilities of the printer. For example, a photo sharing site could
          provide a bandwidth-optimized image for display on screen, but a
          high-resolution image for print. The same technique could also be
          used for e-book formats, such as <a href=
          "http://idpf.org/epub">EPUB</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, displaying a color image on monochrome media (e.g., paper
          and e-ink displays) can be problematic: different colors with similar
          luminosity are impossible to distinguish on monochrome media. This
          problem is illustrated in the figure below, where it becomes nearly
          impossible to associate slices of a pie chart with corresponding
          labels.

              Two pie charts, one in color and one in black and white, which
              demonstrate the problem with switching from color to monochrome
              media. In the black and white graph, it is extremely difficult to
              know which slice relates to which label (except in the case of
              "commute", which is a lighter shade).

          Currently, server side solutions exist to adapt web content to e-ink
          displays (e.g., <a href="http://kinstant.com/">kinstant</a>), but
          such services only work on text and layout and not on images. As
          interpreting the meaning of images is a problem of <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>, it is
          infeasible that this problem can ever be computationally solved. The
          only feasible solution is for authors to provide alternative image
          content that communicates effectively in monochrome media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, through the<a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media Queries
          specifications</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS
          Working Group</a> continues to add media features to the Web
          platform. New media features in <a href=
          "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/">CSS Media Queries level
          4</a> include <a href=
          "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/#script">script</a>, <a href=

          and &nbsp;<a href=
          "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/#luminosity">luminosity</a>.
          The lack of a declarative mechanism to associate image content with
          media features means that developers cannot use them without relying
          on the aforementioned problematic <span>techniques</span>.

        <h3>
          Relative units
        </h3>
        <p>
          A common practice in creating flexible layouts is to specify the size
          values in media queries as relative units: <code>em</code>,
          <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code> etc. See, for
          example, Lyza Gardner's article <a href=
          "http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/">
          <cite>The EMs have it: Proportional Media Queries FTW!</cite></a> .
          This approach commonly uses <code>em</code>s in order to reflow
          layouts based on users’ default font size preferences, and to avoid
          cases where the layout breaks for users or devices who set a default
          font-size that is other than the usual 16px.
        </p>
        <p>
          In flexible layout designs with <code>em</code> based media queries,
          if art-directed images are not specified in relative units, they can
          either break the layout or become distorted when faced with a
          untypical default font-size.

          API to manipulate sources
        </h3>
        <p>
          In some cases the image data is dynamically generated (e.g., using
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">the <code>canvas</code>
          element</a> and related APIs) or is acquired from the device itself
          (e.g., from the camera on a phone or tablet using some form of media
          capture). Developers need practical means to interface
          programmatically with the source of an image or a set of images.
          Without having a suitable API, it will be difficult for developers to
          manipulate the sources of images or to even know what source is
          currently being displayed.

          Image formats

        <p>
          Some images are best suited to a specific file type for reasons such
          as file size optimization, alpha transparency, scalability,
          animation, etc. For example, a photo usually requires good color
          depth, but does not require alpha transparency or animation; JPEG or
          WebP are well-suited to these needs and offer good optimization
          between image quality and file size. Icons are often simpler in terms
          of color depth, but may require alpha transparency; the PNG and WebP
          format is better-suited to these needs.

          In a responsive design, images need to be displayed at different
          sizes. When possible, a vector format such as SVG might be most
          appropriate. There have also been proposals for new responsive image
          formats (see, for example, <a href=
          "http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/need-responsive-image-format">Christopher

        <p>
          Although a web developer may want to use a specific image format, new
          or otherwise, the browser may not always support it. Currently,
          developers are forced to abandon the most suitable image format in
          favor of one that has good user agent support.

          User control over sources
        </h3>
        <p>
          In situations where the user knows their bandwidth is limited or
          expensive (e.g., while roaming), the browser could assist users by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>giving users an option to only download images in the quality
          they desire - or disable images all together, as Google Chrome
          currently does through site preferences.
          </li>
          <li>automatically select the most suitable image for the browsing
          environment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are browsers already catering for these kinds of situations:
          for example Opera Mini provides users with a choice of image quality
          (but those images are compressed on the server). Amazon's Silk
          browser also compresses images "in the cloud" (i.e., through their
          own proxy servers) before serving those images to a user's device.

          Performance oriented
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the main needs from a responsive images solution is speed, and
          specifically it needs to result in faster page loads than the current
          JavaScript based solutions are providing.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key aspects of resource download in the browser is the
          browser's ability to kick-off the resource download as soon as the
          tag containing the resource is read (but possibly before it is
          parsed, since the parser may be blocked).
        </p>
        <p>
          A responsive images solution need to maintain that aspect of image
          loading, in order to avoid introducing delays to the page load, which
          are counter-productive to one of the main goals of responsive images.

            The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> provide
            developers with a means to programmatically interface with image
            resources, as well as access relevant attributes and methods that
            make the solution practical to work with (i.e., it shouldn't
            require complicated Regex or nested loops to manipulate values). In
            addition, the <a href="#solution">solution</a> MUST provide means
            to hook into relevant events resulting from changes in state
            (<a href=

            broken</a>). In any case, an API SHOULD provide a means to:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the current source of the image.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine what environmental condition caused the current
                source to be selected (reflected as, for example, a CSS Media
                Query).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Add, remove, and update image sources.

          <p>
            The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> afford
            developers the ability to explicitly define different image
            versions as opposed to only different resolutions of the same
            image.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> afford
            developers the ability to define the breakpoints for images as
            either minimum values (mobile first) or maximum values (desktop
            first) to match the media queries used in their design.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">SHOULD</em> allow

            format of a set of image sources).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To provide compatibility with legacy user agents, it SHOULD be
            possible for developers to <a href=

            the <span>solution</span>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">SHOULD</em> afford user
        agents with the ability to provide a user-settable preference for
        controlling which source of an image they prefer.&nbsp;For example,
        &nbsp;preference options could include: "always lowest resolution",
        "always high resolution", "download high resolution as bandwidth
        permits", and so on. To be clear, user agents are not required to
        provide such a user-settable preference, but the <span>solution</span>
        needs to be designed in such a way that it could be done.
