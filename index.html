      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>, a user agent's
        <dfn>environmental conditions</dfn> are primarily expressed as CSS
        <dfn>media features</dfn> (e.g., pixel-density, orientation, max-width,
        etc.) and CSS media types (e.g., print, screen, etc.). A
        <dfn>responsive image</dfn> is an image that adapts in response to
        different <a>environmental conditions</a>: adaptations can include, but
        are not limited to, changing the dimensions, crop, or even the source
        of an image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media
        features</a> are dynamic in nature (e.g., a browser window is re-sized,
        a device is rotated from portrait to landscape, and so on), thus a user
        agent constantly responds to events that change the properties of media
        features. As a document's layout adapts to changes in media features
        and <a>media type</a>, an image's ability to communicate effectively
        can be significantly reduced (e.g., images start to show compression
        artifacts as they are scaled to match the quality of media or some
        media feature). When this happens, developers rely on various <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        client/server-side solutions</a> to present images at different
        resolutions, or even in different formats. Swapping images provides a
        means to continue communicating effectively as media features
        dynamically change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, as the <a href=
        "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/wiki/Display-technologies:-beyond-Retina">
        number and varieties of high-density screens has increased</a> (both on
        mobile and desktop devices), web developers have had to create custom
        techniques for serving images that best match a browser's
        <a>environmental conditions</a>. For a list of examples of the range of
        <dfn>techniques</dfn> in use in 2012, see Chris Coyier's article
        "<a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">Which
        responsive images solution should you use?</a>". These techniques have
        a number of limitations, discussed below, which serve as the motivation
        to standardize a solution through the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a>
        and <a href="http://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In formulating the requirements, this document tries to be
        <em>neutral</em> - it is not predicated on any solution. The document
        only tries to describe the use cases and what the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> understands, from
        <a href=
        "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/wiki/Relevant-resources#articles">
        practice</a>, would be needed to address the use cases in the form of
        <a>requirements</a>. The <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> expects that a
        technical specification can be created to formally address each of the
        <a>requirements</a> (i.e., the <dfn>solution</dfn>).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Proposed Solutions
        </h3>
        <p>
          To date, three such specifications are currently under development,
          described below. The three proposed solutions are not mutually
          exclusive: together they address the set of <cite><a href=
          "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org">Use Cases and Requirements for
          Responsive Images</a></cite>.
        </p>

          <dt>
            <cite><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">The `srcset`
            attribute</a></cite>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Allows authors to define various image resources and “hints” that
            assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate image source
            to display. Given a set of image resources, the user agent has the
            option of either following or overriding the author’s declarations
            to optimize the user experience based on criteria such as <a href=
            "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching">display
            density</a>, connection type, <a href=
            "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#user-control-over-sources">user
            preferences</a>, and so on.

            element</a></cite>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Building on <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">srcset</a>,
            this specification defines a declarative solution for grouping
            multiple versions of an image based on different characteristics
            (e.g., format, resolution, orientation, etc.). This allows the user
            agent to select the optimum image to present to an end-user based
            on the user agent's environmental conditions, while also providing
            the ability to "<a title="art direction">art direct</a>" images.
          </dd>

            <cite><a href=

            Client Hints</a></cite>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Defines a set of HTTP headers that allow browsers to indicate a
            list of device and agent specific preferences. Servers can then use
            these "client hints" to assist in content negotiation, ideally
            resulting in content being served that best matches the
            environmental conditions of the client for the resource being
            requested.

      <h2>
        Limitations of current techniques
      </h2>
      <p>
        As currently there are no standardized solutions implemented in main
        stream browsers, web developers are relying on various <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        techniques</a> to use responsive images in their applications.
        Unfortunately, there are significant <dfn>limitations</dfn> with these
        <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        techniques</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Reliance on semantically neutral elements and CSS backgrounds:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Large images incur unnecessary download and processing time,
            slowing the experience for users. To work around this problem, web
            developers specify multiple sources of the same image at different
            resolutions and then pick the image of the correct size based on
            the viewport size. As web developers lack the markup to achieve
            what they need, they end up relying on semantically neutral
            elements, <a href=
            "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds/#background-image">CSS
            background images</a>, and JavaScript libraries. In other words,
            developers are being forced to willfully violate the authoring
            requirements of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Bypass preload scanner
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The reliance on semantically neutral elements (e.g., the
            <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> elements), instead of
            semantically meaningful elements such as <code>img</code>, prevents
            browsers from loading the image resources until after the DOM has
            (at least partially) loaded and scripts have run. This directly
            hinders the performance work browser engineers have done over the
            years to optimize resource loading (e.g., WebKit's <a href=
            "https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp">
            HTMLPreloadScanner</a>). Unnecessarily bypassing things like the
            preload scanner can have measurable performance impact when loading
            documents. See, for example, "<a href=
            "gent.ilcore.com/2011/01/webkit-preloadscanner.html">The WebKit
            PreloadScanner</a>" by Tony Gentilcore for a small study that
            demonstrates an up to 20% impact in load time when WebKit's
            PreloadScanner is disabled. More recent <a href=
            "https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/8AwRUE7wqAE">performance
            tests</a> yield similar results.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Reliance on scripts and server-side processing:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The <a href=
            "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
            techniques</a> rely on either JavaScript or a server-side solution
            (or both), which adds complexity and redundant HTTP requests to the
            development process. Furthermore, the script-based solutions are
            unavailable to users who have turned off JavaScript.

        The <abbr title="Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr>

        <a>limitations</a>.

      <h2>
        Use cases
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following <dfn>use cases</dfn> represent usage scenarios commonly
        seen "in the wild".
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Resolution switching
        </h3>
        <p>
          Image dimensions in responsive layouts tend to vary according to the
          viewport size. This often results in large images being sent to
          browsers with narrow viewports, which are then resized by the browser
          to fit the design (see, for example, "<a href=
          "http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/">Retina
          Revolution</a>" by Daan Jobsis).
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a need for browsers to request image resources whose display
          dimensions closely match the layout dimensions. Sending the right
          image for the given dimension avoids delaying the page load, wasting
          bandwidth, and reducing the impact on battery life (as the device's
          antenna can be powered off more quickly). It can also potentially
          save users money by not downloading redundant image data.

            Resolution switching based on device-pixel-ratio:

            To display images in a way that reduces perceptable artifacts
            (i.e., so the images look "crisp"), devices with different screen
            densities require images with different minimal resolutions. Thus,
            the higher the pixel density, the more pixels the image needs to
            have to look good. This also applies to icons, where completely
            different images may need to be used for different
            device-pixel-ratios (see "All the sizes of iOS app icons", by Neven
            Mrgan).

          Art direction
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a responsive design, it is typical to change an image so it can be
          targeted towards the features of a particular display (or set of
          displays). Sometimes this means cropping an image. Other times, it
          can mean a different image altogether that may have different
          proportions or may be changed in other ways to communicate more
          effectively in a layout. This means, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On a large screen, a large image with plenty of details can be
          shown (e.g., an object with a broad background).
          </li>
          <li>On a smaller screen, shrinking the same image can reduce its
          relevance, usefulness, and legibility. Thus, by "art directing", a
          web developer can better control communication by explicitly
          dictating which image should be shown at which size (or when some <a>
            environmental condition</a> is met).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is illustrated in the figure below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <div>
            <img src="images/art_direction.jpg" width="800" height="520" style=
            "max-width:800px" class="stretchy" alt=
            "four devices showing art directed crops of a dog">
          </div>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              Using different images that have been cropped to fit a particular
              screen's features can help in communicating a message
              effectively.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A related use case is when orientation determines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the source of the image,
          </li>
          <li>the crop,
          </li>
          <li>and how text flows around the image based on the size of the
          viewport.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, on the Nokia Lumia site where it describes the <a href=
          "http://browser.nokia.com/smartphones.html">Meego browser</a>, the
          Nokia Lumia is shown horizontally on wide screens. As the screen
          narrows, the Nokia Lumia is then shown vertically and cropped. Bryan
          and Stephanie Rieger, the designers of the site, explained that on a
          wide screen, showing the full phone horizontally showed the browser
          best; but on small screens, changing the image to vertical made more
          sense because it allowed the reader to still make out the features of
          the browser in the image.

        <h3>
          Design breakpoints
        </h3>
        <p>
          In Web development, a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> is one of a series of
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media
          Queries</a>, which can update the styles of a page based on matching
          of <a>media features</a>. A single breakpoint represents a rule (or
          set of rules) that determines the point at which the contents of that
          media query are applied to a page’s layout. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
@media screen and (max-width: 16em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 32em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 41em) { ... }
</pre>
        <p>
          Developers currently match specific <a>breakpoints</a> for images to
          the breakpoints that they have defined in the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> for their
          applications. Being able to match the breakpoints ensures that images
          are operating under the same rules that define the layout of a
          design. It also helps developers verify their approach by ensuring
          that the same viewport measurement tests are being used in both
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>. If the
          developer cannot specify breakpoints for images in the same manner
          that they are defined for the design, developers will need to convert
          the breakpoints back to the values specified in the layout in order
          to verify that they match. This increases authoring time and the
          likelihood of human-error on the part of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <a>breakpoint</a> is specified as "<code>max-width:
          41em</code>", then web developers would like to define a similar
          breakpoint for images at a <code>max-width</code> of
          <code>41em</code>. Otherwise they are forced to transform
          measurements into another unit, like pixels, which is tedious and
          potentially error-prone.

          Matching media features and media types

        <p>
          According to <cite>Wikipedia's</cite> article on "<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dots per inch</a>":
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "An&nbsp;inkjet printer&nbsp;… is typically capable of 300-600 DPI.
            A&nbsp;laser printer&nbsp;… [prints] in the range of 600 to

          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As printers generally have the ability to pack more points per inch
          than a device's screen, printers have to compensate for the lack of
          pixel data by applying&nbsp;<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
          "Reprographic">reprographic</a>&nbsp;techniques, such as <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">half toning</a>, to
          simulate&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_tone"
          title="Continuous tone">continuous tone</a>&nbsp;in imagery. As
          illustrated below, applying such techniques can cause images to look
          blurry and low-quality when compared to text.

              Example of a 48px by 48px image and text printed at 1,200 DPI.
              Because of the lack of image data, the printer compensates by
              using the <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a> <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
              "Reprographic">reprographic</a> technique. Note that the text
              stays crisp and is printed at the full 1,200 DPI.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Allowing developers to reference images at different resolutions
          could allow user agents to choose an image that best matches the
          capabilities of the printer. For example, a photo sharing site could
          provide a bandwidth-optimized image for display on screen, but a
          high-resolution image for print. The same technique could also be
          used for e-book formats, such as <a href=
          "http://idpf.org/epub">EPUB</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, displaying a color image on monochrome media (e.g., paper
          and e-ink displays) can be problematic: different colors with similar
          luminosity are impossible to distinguish on monochrome media. This
          problem is illustrated in the figure below, where it becomes nearly
          impossible to associate slices of a pie chart with corresponding
          labels.

              know which slice relates to which label (except in the case of
              "commute", which is a lighter shade).

          Currently, server-side solutions exist to adapt web content to e-ink
          displays (e.g., <a href="http://kinstant.com/">kinstant</a>), but
          such services only work on text and layout and not on images. As
          interpreting the meaning of images is a problem of <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>, it is
          infeasible that this problem can ever be computationally solved. The
          only feasible solution is for authors to provide alternative image
          content that communicates effectively in monochrome media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, through the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media Queries
          specifications</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS
          Working Group</a> continues to add media features to the Web

          The lack of a declarative mechanism to associate image content with

        <h3>
          Relative units
        </h3>
        <p>
          A common practice in creating flexible layouts is to specify the size
          values in media queries as relative units: <code>em</code>,
          <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code> etc. See, for
          example, Lyza Gardner's article <a href=
          "http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/">
          <cite>The EMs have it: Proportional Media Queries FTW!</cite></a> .
          This approach commonly uses <code>em</code>s in order to reflow
          layouts based on users’ default font size preferences, and to avoid
          cases where the layout breaks for users or devices who set a default
          font-size that is other than the usual 16px.
        </p>
        <p>
          In flexible layout designs with <code>em</code> based media queries,
          if art-directed images are not specified in relative units, they can
          either break the layout or become distorted when faced with a
          uncommon default font-size (e.g., Amazon's Kindle defaults to 20px
          instead of the usual 16px).
        </p>
        <figure>
          <div>
            <img src="images/rel-units-bad.jpg" alt=

            "images/rel-units-good.jpg" alt=
            "Art direction with relative units produces the desired layout">
          </div>
          <figcaption>
            At the usual default font-size of 16px, the Media Query’s 30em
            breakpoint and the art direction’s 480px breakpoint are equivalent.
            If the user changes the default font-size to something other than
            16px, such as 24px in this example, the Media Query and Art
            Direction breakpoints are no longer equivalent and the layout
            breaks. Using em-based breakpoints for art direction solves this
            problem.

          API to manipulate sources

        <p>
          In some cases the image data is dynamically generated (e.g., using
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">the <code>canvas</code>
          element</a> and related APIs) or is acquired from the device itself
          (e.g., from the camera on a phone or tablet using some form of media
          capture). Developers need practical means to interface
          programmatically with the source of an image or a set of images.
          Without having a suitable API, it will be difficult for developers to
          manipulate the sources of images or to even know what source is
          currently being displayed.

          Image formats

          Some images are best suited to a specific file type for reasons such
          as file size optimization, alpha transparency, scalability,
          animation, etc. For example, a photo usually requires good color
          depth, but does not require alpha transparency or animation; JPEG or
          WebP are well-suited to these needs and offer good optimization
          between image quality and file size. Icons are often simpler in terms
          of color depth, but may require alpha transparency; the PNG and WebP
          format is better-suited to these needs.

        <p>
          In a responsive design, images need to be displayed at different
          sizes and device pixel ratios. When possible, a vector format such as
          SVG might be most appropriate. There have also been proposals for new
          responsive image formats (see, for example, <a href=
          "http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/need-responsive-image-format">Christopher
          Schmitt's .net article</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although a web developer may want to use a specific image format, new
          or otherwise, the browser may not always support it. Currently,
          developers are forced to abandon the most suitable image format in
          favor of one that has ubiquitous support across user agents.

          User control over sources
        </h3>
        <p>
          In situations where the user knows their bandwidth is limited or
          expensive (e.g., while roaming), the browser could assist users by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Giving users an option to only download images in the quality
          they desire - or disable images all together, as Google Chrome
          currently does through site preferences.
          </li>
          <li>Automatically select the most suitable image for the browsing
          environment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are browsers already catering for these kinds of situations:
          for example Opera Mini provides users with a choice of image quality
          (but those images are compressed on the server). Amazon's Silk
          browser also compresses images "in the cloud" (i.e., through their
          own proxy servers) before serving those images to a user's device.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Performance oriented
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the main needs from a responsive images solution is speed, and
          specifically it needs to result in faster page loads than the current
          <a>techniques</a> are providing. One of the key aspects of resource
          download in the browser is the browser's ability to kick-off the
          resource download as soon as the tag containing the resource is read
          (but possibly before it is parsed, since the parser may be blocked).

      <h2>
        Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <a>use cases</a> give rise to the following
        <dfn>requirements</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To allow for art direction, the <a>solution</a> MUST afford
            developers the ability to match image sources with particular media
            features and/or media types - and the user agent SHOULD update the
            source of an image as the media features and media types of the
            browser environment change dynamically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST degrade gracefully on legacy user agents
            by, for example, relying on HTML's built-in fallback mechanisms and
            legacy elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers with the ability to
            include content that is accessible to assistive technologies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST NOT require server-side processing to
            work. However, if required, server-side adaptation can still occur
            through <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">content
            negotiation</a> or similar techniques (i.e., they are not mutually
            exclusive).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST provide developers with a means to
            programmatically interface with image resources, as well as access
            relevant attributes and methods that make the solution practical to
            work with (i.e., it shouldn't require complicated Regex or nested
            loops to manipulate values). In addition, the <a href=
            "#solution">solution</a> MUST provide means to hook into relevant
            events resulting from changes in state (<a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-none">unavailable</a>,
            <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-inc">
            partially available</a>, <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-all">
            completely available</a>, <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-error">
            broken</a>). In any case, an API SHOULD provide a means to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the current source of the image.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine what environmental condition caused the current
                source to be selected (reflected as, for example, a CSS Media
                Query).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Add, remove, and update image sources.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Deal with events.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers the ability to
            explicitly define different image versions as opposed to only
            different resolutions of the same image.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers the ability to define
            the breakpoints for images as either minimum values (mobile first)
            or maximum values (desktop first) to match the media queries used
            in their design.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> SHOULD allow developers to specify images in
            different formats (or specify the format of a set of image
            sources).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To provide compatibility with legacy user agents, it SHOULD be
            possible for developers to <a href=
            "http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/">polyfill</a>
            the <a>solution</a>. See the <a href=
            "https://github.com/w3ctag/extending-html-responsibly/blob/master/RICG-recs/ricg.md">
            W3C's TAG's recommendations to the RICG.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> SHOULD afford user agents with the ability to
            provide a user-settable preference for controlling which source of
            an image they prefer.&nbsp;For example, &nbsp;preference options
            could include: "always lowest resolution", "always high
            resolution", "download high resolution as bandwidth permits", and
            so on. To be clear, user agents are not required to provide such a
            user-settable preference, but the <a>solution</a> needs to be
            designed in such a way that it could be done.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In order to avoid introducing delays to the page load, the solution
            MUST intergrate well with existing performance optimization
            provided by browsers (e.g., the preload scanner).
