<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> In <span><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a></span>, a user agent's <dfn>environmental conditions</dfn> are primarily expressed as  CSS <dfn>media features</dfn> (e.g., max-width, orientation, monochrome, etc.) and CSS media types (e.g., print, screen, etc.). A <dfn>responsive image</dfn> is an image that a developer explicitly adapts in response to different <span>environmental conditions</span>: adaptations can include, but are not limited to, changing the width, height, or even the source of an image.</p>
<p>Many <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media features</a> are dynamic in nature (e.g.,  a browser window is re-sized, a device is rotated from portrait to landscape, and so on), thus a user agent constantly responds to events that change the properties of media features. As a web page's layout adapts to changes in media features and media type,  an image's ability to communicate effectively can be significantly reduced (e.g., images start to show compression artefacts as they are scaled to match the quality of media or some media feature). When this happens, developers rely on <span>responsive images</span> to present images at different resolutions, or even in different formats (e.g., swapping to SVG), to make sure their images continue communicating effectively. </p>
<p>Furthermore, as the number and varieties of high-density screens has increased (both on mobile and desktop devices), web developers have had to create custom techniques  for serving images that best match a browser's <span>environmental conditions</span>. For a list of examples of the range of <dfn>techniques</dfn> in use in 2012, see Chris Coyier's article "<a href="http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">Which responsive images solution should you use?</a>". These techniques have a number of shortcomings, which are discussed below (and these shortcomings serve as the motivation to reach out to the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a> and <a href="http://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a> for standardization).</p>
<p>In formulating the requirements, this document tries to be <em>neutral</em> - it is not predicated on any solution. The document only tries to describe the use cases and what the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title="Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> understands, from practice, would be needed to address the use cases in the form of <span>requirements</span>. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title="Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> expects that a technical specification can be created to formally address each of the <span>requirements</span> (i.e., the <dfn>solution</dfn>). To date, two such specifications are currently under development: </p>
<ul>
  <li><cite><a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">The picture element: An HTML extension for responsive images</a></cite>. </li>
  <li><cite><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">The srcset attribute: An HTML extension for adaptive images</a></cite>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the one hand, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">the `srcset` attribute</a> allows authors to define various image resources and “hints” that assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate image source to display. Given a set of image resources, the user agent has the option of either following or overriding the author’s declarations to optimize the user experience based on criteria such as <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching">display density</a>, connection type, <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#user-control-over-sources">user preferences</a>, and so on.</p>

On the other hand, <a href="http://picture.responsiveimages.org">the `picture` element</a> defines conditions under which the browser should follow the author's intentions when selecting which resource to display. This includes image source sizes designed to align with layouts variations specified in CSS media queries ( see: <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#design-breakpoints">design breakpoints</a>, <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#matching-media-features-and-media-types">media features and types</a> and <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#relative-units">relative units</a> ) or content variations for increased clarity and focus based on the <a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction">client’s display size</a>.

<p>The two proposed solutions are not mutually exclusive: together they address the  set of <cite><a href="http://usecases.responsiveimages.org">Use Cases and Requirements for Responsive Images</a></cite>.</p>
<h2>Problems with current techniques</h2>
<p>There are a number of problems with the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">techniques</a> currently being relied on by web developers: </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Reliance on  semantically neutral elements and CSS backgrounds: </dt>
  <dd>
    <p> Large images incur unnecessary download and processing time, slowing the experience for users. To solve this problem, web developers  provide multiple sources of the same image at different resolutions and then pick the image of the correct size  based on the viewport size. This is commonly done for CSS background images in responsive designs, but web developers lack the markup to do so for images in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> without hacking together a solution. This means that developers have resorted to using <code>div</code> and other container elements to achieve the desired functionality. </p>
    <p>In other words, developers are being forced to work around, or completely ignore, authoring requirements of <span><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a></span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Reliance on scripts and server side processing: </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The <a href="http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">techniques</a> rely on either JavaScript or a server-side solution (or both), which adds  complexity and redundant HTTP requests to the development process. Furthermore, the script-based solutions will be unavailable to users who have turned off JavaScript.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>The <abbr title="Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr> believes  standardization of a browser-based solution can overcome these problems. </p>
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>The following <dfn>use cases</dfn> represent situations in which Web developers see a need for a browser-based solution for working with responsive images.</p>
<h3>Resolution switching</h3>
<p> Web developers often need to provide different versions of the same image in order to communicate effectively across the wide range of screen resolutions and pixel densities available on today's devices. If the screen is small and the image is scaled down, its details cannot be seen. Conversely, if the screen is large a larger image that depicts more information can be shown. This can also sometimes help save bandwidth, in that only the  image best fits the viewport is served to the user. </p>
<figure>
  <div><img src="images/devices.png" class="stretchy" width="800" height="500" style="max-width:800px" alt="four devices showing the same image, but those images all have distinct sources and sizes"></div>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Image specifically resized to be targeted at each device. The intention is to save bandwidth and allow the images to download faster on the targeted screen.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Art direction</h3>
<p>In a responsive design, it is typical to change an image so it can 
  be targeted towards the features of a particular display (or set of displays). Sometimes this means cropping an image. Other times, it can mean a new form of an 
  image that may have different proportions or may be changed in other ways to match changes in the layout. This means, for example: </p>
<ul>
  <li>On large screens, a large image  is shown (e.g.,  an object or person with a broad background).</li>
  <li>On smaller screens, shrinking the image can reduce its relevance, usefulness, and legibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is illustrated in the figure below. </p>
<figure>
  <div><img src="images/art_direction.jpg" width="800" height="520" style="max-width:800px" class="stretchy" alt="four devices showing art directed crops of a dog"></div>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Using different images that have been cropped to fit a particular screen's features can help in communicating a message effectively. </p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A related use case is when orientation determines:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the source of the image,</li>
  <li> the crop,</li>
  <li> and how text flows around the image based on the size of the viewport. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, on the Nokia Lumia site where it describes the <a href="http://browser.nokia.com/smartphones.html">Meego browser</a>, the Nokia Lumia  is shown horizontally on wide screens. As the screen narrows, the Nokia Lumia is then shown vertically and cropped. Bryan and Stephanie Rieger, the designers of the site, explained that on a wide screen, showing the full phone horizontally showed the browser best; but on small screens, changing the image to vertical made more sense because it allowed the reader to still make out the features of the browser in the image.</p>

<h3>Design breakpoints</h3>
<p>In Web development, a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> is one of a series of CSS Media Queries that updates the styles of a page based on logical matching of media features. A single breakpoint represents a rule (or set of rules) that determines the point at which the contents of that media query are applied to a page’s layout. For example:</p>
<pre class="example">
@media screen and (max-width: 16em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 32em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 41em) { ... }</pre>
<p>Developers currently match specific <span>breakpoints</span> for images to the breakpoints that they have defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> of their responsive designs. Being able to match the breakpoints ensures that images are operating under the same rules that define the layout of a design. It also helps developers verify their approach by ensuring that the same viewport measurement tests are being used in both <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>.  If the developer cannot specify breakpoints for images in the same manner that they are defined for the design, developers will need to convert the breakpoints back to the values specified in the layout in order to verify that they match. This increases authoring time and the likelihood of errors on the part of developers.</p>
<p> For example, if a <span>breakpoint</span> is specified  as &quot;<span class="example"><code>max-width: 41em</code></span>&quot;, then web developers would like to define a similar breakpoint for images at a <code>max-width</code> of <code>41em</code>. Otherwise they are forced to transform measurements into another unit like pixels, which is tedious and potentially error-prone for developers.</p>
<h3> Matching media features and media types</h3>
<p> According to <cite>Wikipedia's</cite> article on "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dots per inch</a>": </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;An inkjet printer &hellip; is typically capable of 300-600 DPI. A laser printer &hellip; [prints] in the range of 600 to 1,800 DPI.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As printers generally have the ability to pack more points per inch than a device's screen, printers have to compensate for the lack of pixel data by applying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title="Reprographic">reprographic</a> techniques, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">half toning</a>, to simulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_tone" title="Continuous tone">continuous tone</a> in imagery. As illustrated below, applying such techniques can cause images to look blurry and low-quality when compared to text. </p>
<figure> <img src="images/printed_image.jpg" width="403" height="107" alt="image comparison between screen and print">
  <figcaption>
    <p>Example of a  48px by 48px image and text printed at 1,200 DPI. Because of the lack of image data, the printer compensates by using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title="Reprographic">reprographic</a> technique. Note that the text stays crisp and is printed at the full 1,200 DPI. </p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Allowing developers to reference images at different resolutions could allow user agents to choose an image that best matches the capabilities of the printer. For example, a photo sharing site could provide a bandwidth-optimized image for display on screen, but a high-resolution image for print. The same technique could also be used for e-book formats, such as <a href="http://idpf.org/epub">EPUB</a>.</p>
<p>However, displaying a color image on monochrome media (e.g., paper and e-ink displays) can be problematic: different colors with similar luminosity are impossible to distinguish on monochrome media. This problem is illustrated in the figure below, where it becomes nearly impossible to associate slices of a pie chart with corresponding labels. </p>
<figure>
  <div><img class="stretchy" src="images/color_and_bw_graph.png" width="560" style="max-width: 560px" height="211" alt="a color and a black and white graph"></div>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Two pie charts, one in color and one in black and white, which demonstrate the problem with switching from color to monochrome media. In the black and white graph, it is extremely difficult to know which slice relates to which label (except in the case of "commute", which is a lighter shade).</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Currently, server side solutions exist to adapt web content to e-ink displays (e.g., <a href="http://kinstant.com/">kinstant</a>), but such services only work on text and layout and not on images. As interpreting the meaning of images is a problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>, it is infeasible that this problem can ever be computationally solved. The only feasible solution is  for authors to provide alternative image content that communicates effectively in monochrome media. </p>
<p>Lastly, through the<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/"> CSS Media Queries specifications</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS Working Group</a> continues to add media features to the Web platform. New media features in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/">CSS Media Queries level 4</a> include <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/#script">script</a>, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/#pointer">pointer</a>, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/#hover">hover</a>, and  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/#luminosity">luminosity</a>. The lack of a declarative mechanism to associate image content  with media features means that developers cannot use them without relying on the aforementioned problematic <span>techniques</span>.</p>
<h3>Relative units</h3>
<p>A common practice in creating flexible layouts is to specify the size values in media queries as relative units: <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code> etc. 
See, for example, Lyza Gardner's article <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/"><cite>The EMs have it: Proportional Media Queries FTW!</cite></a> . 
This approach commonly uses <code>em</code>s in order to reflow layouts based on users’ default font size preferences, and to avoid cases
where the layout breaks for users or devices who set a default font-size that is other than the usual 16px. </p>
<p>In flexible layout designs with <code>em</code> based media queries, if art-directed images are not specified in relative units, they can either break the layout or become
distorted when faced with a untypical default font-size. 
</p>
<h3>API to manipulate sources</h3>
<p>In some cases the image data is dynamically generated (e.g., using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">the <code>canvas</code> element</a> and related APIs) or is acquired from the device itself (e.g., from the camera on a phone or tablet using some form of media capture). Developers need practical means to interface programmatically with the source of an image or a set of images. Without having a suitable API, it will be difficult for developers to manipulate the sources of images or to even know what source is currently being displayed. </p>
<h3>Image formats</h3>
<p>Some images are best suited to a specific file type for reasons such as file size optimization, alpha transparency, scalability, animation, etc. For example, a photo usually requires good color depth, but does not require alpha transparency or animation; JPEG or WebP are well-suited to these needs and offer good optimization between image quality and file size. Icons are often simpler in terms of color depth, but may require alpha transparency; the PNG and WebP format is better-suited to these needs.</p>
<div class="issue">
  <p>Sharing URLs for formats that are not interoperable across browsers is a problem in the wild. See <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/ri-usecases/issues/11">issue 11</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>In a responsive design, images need to be displayed at different sizes. When possible, a vector format such as SVG might be most appropriate. There have also been proposals for new responsive image formats (see, for example, <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/need-responsive-image-format">Christopher Schmitt's .net article</a>).</p>
<p>Although a web developer may want to use a specific image format, new or otherwise, the browser may not always support it. Currently, developers are forced to  abandon the most suitable image format in favor of one that has good user agent support.</p>
<h3>User control over sources</h3>
<p>In situations where the user knows  their bandwidth is limited or expensive (e.g., while roaming), the browser could assist users by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>giving users an option to only download images in the quality they desire - or disable images all together, as Google Chrome currently does through site preferences. </li>
  <li>automatically select the most suitable image for the browsing environment. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are browsers already catering for these kinds of situations: for example Opera Mini provides users with a choice of image quality (but those images are compressed on the server). Amazon's Silk browser also compresses images "in the cloud" (i.e., through their own proxy servers) before serving those images to a user's device.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The <span>use cases</span> give rise to the following <dfn>requirements</dfn>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> afford developers the ability to match image sources with particular  media features  and/or media types - and have the user agent update the source of an image as the media features and media types of the browser environment change dynamically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> degrade gracefully on legacy user agents by, for example, relying on <span>HTML</span>'s built-in fallback mechanisms and legacy elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> afford developers with the ability to include  content  that is accessible to assistive technologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST NOT</em> require server-side processing to work. However, if required, server-side adaptation can still occur through <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">content negotiation</a> or similar techniques (i.e., they are not mutually exclusive). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
     <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> provide developers with a means to programmatically interface with  image resources, as well as access relevant attributes and methods that make the solution practical to work with (i.e., it shouldn't  require complicated Regex or nested loops to manipulate values). In addition, the <a href="#solution">solution</a> MUST provide means to hook into relevant events resulting from changes in state (<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-none">unavailable</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-inc">partially available</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-all">completely available</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-error">broken</a>). In any case, an API SHOULD provide a means to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Determine the current source of the image.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Determine what environmental condition caused the current source to be selected (reflected as, for example, a CSS Media Query). </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add, remove, and update image sources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Deal with events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> afford developers the ability to explicitly define different image versions as opposed to only different resolutions of the same image. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">MUST</em> afford developers  the ability to  define the breakpoints for images as either minimum values (mobile first) or maximum values (desktop first) to match the media queries used in their design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">SHOULD</em> allow developers to specify images in different formats (or specify the format of a set of image sources).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To provide compatibility with legacy user agents, it SHOULD be possible for developers to <a href="http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/">polyfill</a> the <span>solution</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span>solution</span> <em class="ct">SHOULD</em> afford user agents with the ability to provide a user-settable preference for controlling which source of an image they prefer. For example,  preference options could include: &quot;always  lowest resolution&quot;, &quot;always high resolution&quot;, &quot;download high resolution as bandwidth permits&quot;, and so on. To be clear, user agents are not required to provide such a user-settable preference, but  the <span>solution</span> needs to be designed in such a way that it could be done.</li>
