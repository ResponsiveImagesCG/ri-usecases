      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>, a user agent's
        <dfn>environmental conditions</dfn> are primarily expressed as CSS
        <dfn>media features</dfn> (e.g., pixel-density, orientation, max-width,
        etc.) and CSS media types (e.g., print, screen, etc.). A
        <dfn>responsive image</dfn> is an image that a developer explicitly
        adapts in response to different <a>environmental conditions</a>:
        adaptations can include, but are not limited to, changing the
        dimensions, crop, or even the source of an image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media
        features</a> are dynamic in nature (e.g., a browser window is re-sized,
        a device is rotated from portrait to landscape, and so on), thus a user
        agent constantly responds to events that change the properties of media
        features. As a document's layout adapts to changes in media features
        and <a>media type</a>, an image's ability to communicate effectively
        can be significantly reduced (e.g., images start to show compression
        artefacts as they are scaled to match the quality of media or some
        media feature). When this happens, developers rely on various <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
        client/server-side solutions</a> to present images at different
        resolutions, or even in different formats. Swapping images provides a
        means to continue communicating effectively as media features
        dynamically change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, as the <a href=
        "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/wiki/Display-technologies:-beyond-Retina">
        number and varieties of high-density screens has increased</a> (both on
        mobile and desktop devices), web developers have had to create custom
        techniques for serving images that best match a browser's
        <a>environmental conditions</a>. For a list of examples of the range of
        <dfn>techniques</dfn> in use in 2012, see Chris Coyier's article
        "<a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">Which
        responsive images solution should you use?</a>". These techniques have
        a number of limitations, discussed below, which serve as the motivation
        to standardization a solution through the <a href=
        "http://w3.org">W3C</a> and <a href="http://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In formulating the requirements, this document tries to be
        <em>neutral</em> - it is not predicated on any solution. The document
        only tries to describe the use cases and what the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> understands, from
        <a href=
        "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/wiki/Relevant-resources#articles">
        practice</a>, would be needed to address the use cases in the form of
        <a>requirements</a>. The <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/"><abbr title=
        "Responsive Images Community Group">RICG</abbr></a> expects that a
        technical specification can be created to formally address each of the
        <a>requirements</a> (i.e., the <dfn>solution</dfn>).
      </p>
      <p>
        To date, three such specifications are currently under development,
        described below. The three proposed solutions are not mutually
        exclusive: together they address the set of <cite><a href=
        "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org">Use Cases and Requirements for
        Responsive Images</a></cite>.

          attribute</a></cite>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Allows authors to define various image resources and “hints” that
          assist a user agent to determine the most appropriate image source to
          display. Given a set of image resources, the user agent has the
          option of either following or overriding the author’s declarations to
          optimize the user experience based on criteria such as <a href=
          "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#resolution-switching">display
          density</a>, connection type, <a href=
          "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#user-control-over-sources">user
          preferences</a>, and so on.

        <dd>
          Building on <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/srcset/">srcset</a>,
          this specification defines a declarative solution for grouping of
          multiple versions of an image based on different characteristics
          (e.g., format, resolution, cropping, etc.). This allows the user
          agent to select the optimum image to present to an end-user based on
          the user agent's environmental conditions.

        </dt>
        <dd>
          Defines a set of HTTP headers that allow browsers to indicate a list
          of device and agent specific preferences. Servers can then use these
          "client hints" to assist in content negotiation, ideally resulting in
          content being served that best matches the environmental conditions
          of the client for the resource being requested.

        Limitations of current techniques
      </h2>
      <p>
        There significant <dfn>limitations</dfn> with the <a href=
        "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">

          Reliance on semantically neutral elements and CSS backgrounds:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Large images incur unnecessary download and processing time,
            slowing the experience for users. To work around this problem, web
            developers specify multiple sources of the same image at different
            resolutions and then pick the image of the correct size based on
            the viewport size. As web developers lack the markup to achieve
            what they need, they end up relying on semantically neutral
            elements, <a href=
            "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds/#background-image">CSS
            background images</a>, and JavaScript libraries. In other words,
            developers are being forced to willfully violate the authoring
            requirements of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a>.

            The <a href=
            "http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">
            techniques</a> rely on either JavaScript or a server-side solution
            (or both), which adds complexity and redundant HTTP requests to the
            development process. Furthermore, the script-based solutions are
            unavailable to users who have turned off JavaScript.

          Bypass preload scanner
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The reliance on semantically neutral elements (e.g., the
            <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> elements), instead of
            semantically meaningful elements such as <code>img</code>, prevents
            browsers from loading the image resources until after the DOM has
            (at least partially) loaded and Javascript has run. This directly
            hinders the performance work browser engineers have done over the
            years to optimize resource loading (e.g., WebKit's <a href=
            "https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp">
            HTMLPreloadScanner</a>). Unnecessarily bypassing things like the
            preload scanner can have measurable performance impact when loading
            documents. See, for example, "<a href=
            "gent.ilcore.com/2011/01/webkit-preloadscanner.html">The WebKit
            PreloadScanner</a>" by Tony Gentilcore for a small study that
            demonstrates an up to 20% impact in load time when WebKit's
            PreloadScanner is disabled. More recent <a href=
            "https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/8AwRUE7wqAE">performance
            tests</a> yield similar results.

        Use cases
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following <dfn>use cases</dfn> represent situations commonly seen
        "in the wild".
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Resolution switching
        </h3>
        <p>
          Image dimensions in responsive layouts tend to vary according to the
          viewport size. This often results in large images being sent to
          browsers with narrow viewports and resized to fit on the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a need to enable browsers to request image resources that
          are as close as possible to these images display dimensions. That is
          in order to avoid delaying the page load, wasting bandwidth, draining
          the user's battery and incurring costs on his data plan, by sending
          him image data that he will not benefit from.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use case can be divided into two sub-categories:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Resolution switching based on device-pixel-ratio
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Different screen densities require different image resolutions in
            order to display the same image dimensions in a crisp,
            artifact-free way

          Art direction
        </h3>
        <p>
          In a responsive design, it is typical to change an image so it can be
          targeted towards the features of a particular display (or set of
          displays). Sometimes this means cropping an image. Other times, it
          can mean a new form of an image that may have different proportions
          or may be changed in other ways to match changes in the layout. This
          means, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On large screens, a large image image with plenty of details can
          be shown (e.g., an object or person with a broad background as shown
          in the figure below).
          </li>
          <li>On smaller screens, shrinking the same image can reduce its
          relevance, usefulness, and legibility. Thus, by "art directing" parts
          that reduce communication are manipulated to better control the
          image's commu
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is illustrated in the figure below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <div>
            <img src="images/art_direction.jpg" width="800" height="520" style=
            "max-width:800px" class="stretchy" alt=
            "four devices showing art directed crops of a dog">
          </div>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              Using different images that have been cropped to fit a particular
              screen's features can help in communicating a message
              effectively.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A related use case is when orientation determines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the source of the image,
          </li>
          <li>the crop,
          </li>
          <li>and how text flows around the image based on the size of the
          viewport.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, on the Nokia Lumia site where it describes the <a href=
          "http://browser.nokia.com/smartphones.html">Meego browser</a>, the
          Nokia Lumia is shown horizontally on wide screens. As the screen
          narrows, the Nokia Lumia is then shown vertically and cropped. Bryan
          and Stephanie Rieger, the designers of the site, explained that on a
          wide screen, showing the full phone horizontally showed the browser
          best; but on small screens, changing the image to vertical made more
          sense because it allowed the reader to still make out the features of
          the browser in the image.

        <h3>
          Design breakpoints
        </h3>
        <p>
          In Web development, a <dfn>breakpoint</dfn> is one of a series of
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media
          Queries</a>, which can update the styles of a page based on matching
          of <a>media features</a>. A single breakpoint represents a rule (or
          set of rules) that determines the point at which the contents of that
          media query are applied to a page’s layout. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
@media screen and (max-width: 16em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 32em) { ... }
@media screen and (max-width: 41em) { ... }
</pre>
        <p>
          Developers currently match specific <a>breakpoints</a> for images to
          the breakpoints that they have defined in the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> of their
          applications. Being able to match the breakpoints ensures that images
          are operating under the same rules that define the layout of a
          design. It also helps developers verify their approach by ensuring
          that the same viewport measurement tests are being used in both
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> and <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>. If the
          developer cannot specify breakpoints for images in the same manner
          that they are defined for the design, developers will need to convert
          the breakpoints back to the values specified in the layout in order
          to verify that they match. This increases authoring time and the
          likelihood of human-error on the part of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a <a>breakpoint</a> is specified as "<code>max-width:
          41em</code>", then web developers would like to define a similar
          breakpoint for images at a <code>max-width</code> of
          <code>41em</code>. Otherwise they are forced to transform
          measurements into another unit, like pixels, which is tedious and
          potentially error-prone.

          Matching media features and media types

        <p>
          According to <cite>Wikipedia's</cite> article on "<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dots per inch</a>":
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "An&nbsp;inkjet printer&nbsp;… is typically capable of 300-600 DPI.
            A&nbsp;laser printer&nbsp;… [prints] in the range of 600 to

          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As printers generally have the ability to pack more points per inch
          than a device's screen, printers have to compensate for the lack of
          pixel data by applying&nbsp;<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
          "Reprographic">reprographic</a>&nbsp;techniques, such as <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">half toning</a>, to
          simulate&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_tone"
          title="Continuous tone">continuous tone</a>&nbsp;in imagery. As
          illustrated below, applying such techniques can cause images to look
          blurry and low-quality when compared to text.

              Example of a 48px by 48px image and text printed at 1,200 DPI.
              Because of the lack of image data, the printer compensates by
              using the <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a> <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprographic" title=
              "Reprographic">reprographic</a> technique. Note that the text
              stays crisp and is printed at the full 1,200 DPI.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Allowing developers to reference images at different resolutions
          could allow user agents to choose an image that best matches the
          capabilities of the printer. For example, a photo sharing site could
          provide a bandwidth-optimized image for display on screen, but a
          high-resolution image for print. The same technique could also be
          used for e-book formats, such as <a href=
          "http://idpf.org/epub">EPUB</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, displaying a color image on monochrome media (e.g., paper
          and e-ink displays) can be problematic: different colors with similar
          luminosity are impossible to distinguish on monochrome media. This
          problem is illustrated in the figure below, where it becomes nearly
          impossible to associate slices of a pie chart with corresponding
          labels.

              Two pie charts, one in color and one in black and white, which
              demonstrate the problem with switching from color to monochrome
              media. In the black and white graph, it is extremely difficult to
              know which slice relates to which label (except in the case of
              "commute", which is a lighter shade).

          Currently, server-side solutions exist to adapt web content to e-ink
          displays (e.g., <a href="http://kinstant.com/">kinstant</a>), but
          such services only work on text and layout and not on images. As
          interpreting the meaning of images is a problem of <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>, it is
          infeasible that this problem can ever be computationally solved. The
          only feasible solution is for authors to provide alternative image
          content that communicates effectively in monochrome media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, through the CSS<a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media Queries
          specifications</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS
          Working Group</a> continues to add media features to the Web
          platform. New media features in <a href=

          4</a> include <a href=

          The lack of a declarative mechanism to associate image content with

          Relative units
        </h3>
        <p>
          A common practice in creating flexible layouts is to specify the size
          values in media queries as relative units: <code>em</code>,
          <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code> etc. See, for
          example, Lyza Gardner's article <a href=
          "http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/">
          <cite>The EMs have it: Proportional Media Queries FTW!</cite></a> .
          This approach commonly uses <code>em</code>s in order to reflow
          layouts based on users’ default font size preferences, and to avoid
          cases where the layout breaks for users or devices who set a default
          font-size that is other than the usual 16px.
        </p>
        <p>
          In flexible layout designs with <code>em</code> based media queries,
          if art-directed images are not specified in relative units, they can
          either break the layout or become distorted when faced with a rare
          default font-size.

          API to manipulate sources
        </h3>
        <p>
          In some cases the image data is dynamically generated (e.g., using
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/">the <code>canvas</code>
          element</a> and related APIs) or is acquired from the device itself
          (e.g., from the camera on a phone or tablet using some form of media
          capture). Developers need practical means to interface
          programmatically with the source of an image or a set of images.
          Without having a suitable API, it will be difficult for developers to
          manipulate the sources of images or to even know what source is
          currently being displayed.

          Image formats

          Some images are best suited to a specific file type for reasons such
          as file size optimization, alpha transparency, scalability,
          animation, etc. For example, a photo usually requires good color
          depth, but does not require alpha transparency or animation; JPEG or
          WebP are well-suited to these needs and offer good optimization
          between image quality and file size. Icons are often simpler in terms
          of color depth, but may require alpha transparency; the PNG and WebP
          format is better-suited to these needs.

          In a responsive design, images need to be displayed at different
          sizes and device pixel ratios. When possible, a vector format such as
          SVG might be most appropriate. There have also been proposals for new
          responsive image formats (see, for example, <a href=
          "http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/need-responsive-image-format">Christopher
          Schmitt's .net article</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although a web developer may want to use a specific image format, new
          or otherwise, the browser may not always support it. Currently,
          developers are forced to abandon the most suitable image format in
          favor of one that has ubiquitous user agent support.

          User control over sources
        </h3>
        <p>
          In situations where the user knows their bandwidth is limited or
          expensive (e.g., while roaming), the browser could assist users by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>giving users an option to only download images in the quality
          they desire - or disable images all together, as Google Chrome
          currently does through site preferences.
          </li>
          <li>automatically select the most suitable image for the browsing
          environment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are browsers already catering for these kinds of situations:
          for example Opera Mini provides users with a choice of image quality
          (but those images are compressed on the server). Amazon's Silk
          browser also compresses images "in the cloud" (i.e., through their
          own proxy servers) before serving those images to a user's device.

        <p>
          One of the main needs from a responsive images solution is speed, and
          specifically it needs to result in faster page loads than the current
          <a>techniques</a> are providing. One of the key aspects of resource
          download in the browser is the browser's ability to kick-off the
          resource download as soon as the tag containing the resource is read
          (but possibly before it is parsed, since the parser may be blocked).
        </p>
        <p>
          A responsive images solution need to maintain that aspect of image
          loading, in order to avoid introducing delays to the page load, which
          are counter-productive to one of the main goals of responsive images.

        Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <a>use cases</a> give rise to the following
        <dfn>requirements</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers the ability to match
            image sources with particular media features and/or media types -
            and have the user agent update the source of an image as the media
            features and media types of the browser environment change
            dynamically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST degrade gracefully on legacy user agents
            by, for example, relying on HTML's built-in fallback mechanisms and
            legacy elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers with the ability to
            include content that is accessible to assistive technologies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST NOT require server-side processing to
            work. However, if required, server-side adaptation can still occur
            through <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">content
            negotiation</a> or similar techniques (i.e., they are not mutually
            exclusive).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST provide developers with a means to
            programmatically interface with image resources, as well as access
            relevant attributes and methods that make the solution practical to
            work with (i.e., it shouldn't require complicated Regex or nested
            loops to manipulate values). In addition, the <a href=
            "#solution">solution</a> MUST provide means to hook into relevant
            events resulting from changes in state (<a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-none">unavailable</a>,
            <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-inc">
            partially available</a>, <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-all">
            completely available</a>, <a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#img-error">
            broken</a>). In any case, an API SHOULD provide a means to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the current source of the image.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine what environmental condition caused the current
                source to be selected (reflected as, for example, a CSS Media
                Query).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Add, remove, and update image sources.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Deal with events.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers the ability to
            explicitly define different image versions as opposed to only
            different resolutions of the same image.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> MUST afford developers the ability to define
            the breakpoints for images as either minimum values (mobile first)
            or maximum values (desktop first) to match the media queries used
            in their design.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <a>solution</a> SHOULD allow developers to specify images in
            different formats (or specify the format of a set of image
            sources).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To provide compatibility with legacy user agents, it SHOULD be
            possible for developers to <a href=
            "http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/">polyfill</a>
            the <a>solution</a>. See the <a href=
            "https://github.com/w3ctag/extending-html-responsibly/blob/master/RICG-recs/ricg.md">
            W3C's TAG's recommendations to the RICG.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>The <a>solution</a> SHOULD afford user agents with the ability to
        provide a user-settable preference for controlling which source of an
        image they prefer.&nbsp;For example, &nbsp;preference options could
        include: "always lowest resolution", "always high resolution",
        "download high resolution as bandwidth permits", and so on. To be
        clear, user agents are not required to provide such a user-settable
        preference, but the <a>solution</a> needs to be designed in such a way
        that it could be done.
